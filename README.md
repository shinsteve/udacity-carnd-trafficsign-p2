Overview
---

This repository is to submit the project of [Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree - Traffic Sign Classification](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project).

In this project, you will use what you've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. You will train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the German Traffic Sign Dataset. After the model is trained, you will then try out your model on images of German traffic signs that you find on the web.
